# Contributing

I'm grateful you're interested in contributing.

## bugs

To get a bug looked at I must be able to recreate it.

1. create an [issue](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman/issues) to describe the bug

2. note the version of the application and any console output when the bug is present - really, anything that will help me recreate your problem.

3. I'm less likely to give a shit if you're being a jerk. If it helps, please add the labels [very frustrated](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman/labels/very%20frustrated) and/or [this fucking sucks](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman/labels/this%20fucking%20sucks) to your issue and keep the tone of the ticket amiable.

## feedback, feature requests

I'm open to feedback and suggestions. They must come in the form of a [github issue](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman/issues) though.

## code

Code contributions must meet certain minimum requirements to be merged in. I can help with these.

1. You need to agree to the project's licence. I won't prompt you or make you sign anything, it will be taken as granted you understand the implications of the licence and agree with it's terms.

2. Pull requests rather than diffs, please. The base target should be `develop`.

3. Every change of your contribution will be reviewed. The more changes there are the less comfortable I'm going to be merging it.

4. Follow the code idioms and don't introduce anything too exotic or complicated or large. Think small incremental changes.

5. Tests! I'm a fan of them. Don't make me write tests for you.

6. I don't care to enforce coding style, use the `lint.sh` script and we'll live with it's decisions.
