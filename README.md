# wowman, a World of Warcraft Addon Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ogri-la/wowman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ogri-la/wowman)

`wowman` is an **open source**, **advertisement free** and **privacy respecting** addon manager for World of Warcraft. 
It interacts with [www.curseforge.com](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons) and 
[wowinterface.com](https://wowinterface.com/addons.php) and with the addons in your `Addons` directory.

## Audience

This software targets World of Warcraft players using Linux.

It may work on other platforms but it is only tested and supported on Linux.

## Requirements

* Java 8+

## Installation

1. [download the jar](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman/releases/download/0.7.2/wowman-0.7.2-standalone.jar) file
2. run with `java -jar wowman-x.x.x-standalone.jar`

### Arch Linux users

A PKGBUILD exists in the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wowman/) 
with a mirror [here](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman-pkgbuild/). 

Once installed it's available from the command line as `wowman`.

## Usage

`wowman` works by matching your installed addons to a list of addons available online.

Some addons match directly to those online but others require you to manually search and re-install them before that 
match can be made.

Some addons come bundled with other addons that *do not appear* in the online list. You will need to re-install the 
'parent' addon that bundles those addons.

First time usage:

1. select your "Addons" directory (`/path/to/WoW/_retail_/Interface/Addons`)
2. from the `Addons` menu select `Re-install all` to automatically re-install all **matching** addons
3. addons that are **not** automatically matched can be searched for and installed from the `search` tab
4. finally, addons can be deleted by selecting them, right-clicking, and selecting `delete`. Multiple addons can be 
selected and removed at once.

Afterwards, simply use the `Update all` button to update all addons with new versions available. 
Addons with new versions available will be highlighted.

## Recognition

Under no circumstances whatsoever does this software:

* deal with advertising or advertisers
* collect, monitor or report upon your usage of `wowman` or your data
* attempt to monitise you, the user, in any way

This software also tries very hard to:

* be plain and uncomplicated
* do the least surprising thing
* clean up after itself
* not cause a bother - for you *or* the addon host

I benefit so much from the hard work of those who write free and open source software, including addon developers, 
that it's my privilege to offer this small piece back.

## Notes

User configuration is stored in `~/.config/wowman` unless run with the envvar `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set.

Temporary data is stored in `~/.local/share/wowman` unless run with the envvar `$XDG_DATA_HOME` set.

Addon zip files are downloaded to your WoW `Addons` directory.

A file called `.wowman.json` is created within newly installed or re-installed addons. This file maps specific 
attributes between the addon host (like curseforge.com) and the addon as well as *across* addons, as some addons unzip 
to multiple directories. It's a simple `txt` file in a structured format called `json`.

Addon zip files, `.wowman.json` files, cached data and `WowMatrix.dat` files can all be removed from the `Cache` menu.

Addon `.zip` files that contain top-level files or top-level directories missing a `.toc` file **will not be installed**
and the downloaded `.zip` file will be deleted immediately. This is a guard against poorly or maliciously constructed
`.zip` files.

Addon `.rar` files are not and will not be supported.

This software interacts with the following remote hosts:

* [www.curseforge.com](https://www.curseforge.com) and [wowinterface.com](https://wowinterface.com) to download detailed 
addon data. These hosts may redirect requests.
* [github.com/ogri-la](https://github.com/ogri-la), to download a list of summary addon information
* [api.github.com](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases), to download the latest `wowman` release data

These interactions use a HTTP user agent header unique to `wowman` so that it may be identified easily.
