# wowman, a World of Warcraft Addon Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ogri-la/wowman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ogri-la/wowman)

`wowman` is an **open source**, **advertisement free** and **privacy respecting** addon manager for World of Warcraft 
that interfaces with [www.curseforge.com](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons) and the addons in your `Addons` 
directory.

## Audience

This software targets World of Warcraft players using Linux.

It may work on other platforms but it is only tested and supported on Linux.

## Requirements

* Java 8+

## Installation

1. [download the jar](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman/releases/download/0.6.0/wowman-0.6.0-standalone.jar) file
2. run with `java -jar wowman-x.x.x-standalone.jar`

### Arch Linux users

A PKGBUILD exists in the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wowman/) 
with a mirror [here](https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman-pkgbuild/). 

Once installed it's available from the command line as `wowman`.

## Usage

`wowman` works by matching your installed addons to a list of addons available online.

Some addons match cleanly to those online but others require you to manually search and re-install them before that 
match can be made.

Some addons come bundled with other addons that *do not appear* in the online list. You will need to re-install the 
'parent' addon that bundles those addons.

First time usage:

1. select your "Addons" directory (`/path/to/WoW/_retail_/Interface/Addons`)
2. from the `Addons` menu select `Re-install all` to automatically re-install all *matching* addons
3. unmatched addons can be searched for and installed from the `search` tab
4. finally, addons can be deleted by selecting them, right-clicking, and selecting `delete`. Multiple addons can be 
selected and removed at once.

Afterwards, daily usage is simply using the `Update all` button to update any addons with newer versions. 
Addons with new versions available will be highlighted.

## Notes

User configuration is stored in `~/.config/wowman` unless run with the envvar `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set.

Temporary data is stored in `~/.local/share/wowman` unless run with the envvar `$XDG_DATA_HOME` set.

Previously a sub-directory called `state` created in the current working directory was used for both data and config.  
This local `state` directory can be safely deleted now.

Addon zip files are downloaded to your WoW `Addons` directory.

A file called `.wowman.json` is created within newly installed or re-installed addons. This file maps specific 
attributes between www.curseforge.com and the addon as well as *across* addons, as some addons unzip to multiple 
directories. It's a simple `txt` file in a structured format called `json`.

This software interacts with the following remote hosts:

* [https://www.curseforge.com](https://www.curseforge.com), to download detailed addon data
* [https://github.com/ogri-la](https://github.com/ogri-la), to download a list of summary addon information
* [https://api.github.com](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases), to download the latest `wowman` release data

These interactions use a HTTP user agent header unique to `wowman` so that it may be identified easily

## Recognition

Under no circumstances whatsoever does this software:

* deal with advertising or advertisers
* collect, monitor or report upon your usage of `wowman` or your data
* attempt to monitise you, the user, in any way

This software also tries very hard to:

* be plain and uncomplicated
* do the least surprising thing
* clean up after itself
* not cause a bother - for you *or* curseforge

I benefit so much from the hard work of those who write free and open source software, including addon developers, 
that it's my privilege to offer this small piece back.
